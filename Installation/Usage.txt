Assuming you have installed the p4c compiler, you can obtain the json file for a
P4_16 v1model program as follows:

    p4c --target bmv2 --arch v1model --std p4-16 <prog>.p4

This will create a `<prog>.json` output file which can now be 'fed' to the bmv2
`simple_switch` binary:

    sudo ./simple_switch -i 0@<iface0> -i 1@<iface1> <prog>.json

In this example \<iface0\> and \<iface1\> are the interfaces which are bound to
the switch (as ports 0 and 1).
